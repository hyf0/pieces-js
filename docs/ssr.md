# SSR

## Webpack

As pieces-js just compile and extract your code into static css file, you could choose `isomorphic-style-loader` or `mini-css-extract-plugin` to implement SSR.

### FYI

- [Critical CSS extraction](https://github.com/callstack/linaria/blob/master/docs/CRITICAL_CSS.md)

## Next.js

If you are using pieces-js with Next.js, you don't need do anything.
